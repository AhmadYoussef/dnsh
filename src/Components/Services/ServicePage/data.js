        <p>The modern poultry industry aims at high production and better quality at a low cost. This, in addition to an increase in the demand for poultry meat, necessitates constant, efficient and goal-oriented healthcare to prevent the development of diseases and other poultry farming related issues.</p>
            <p>working with our partner to bring competitive, uncomplicated and sustainable solutions that lead to successful farm and profitable production. </p>
            <p>Dnsh expertise in the common problems facing poultry farming include the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Financial issues in poultry farming system: This is one the most important problem which we believe affect more than 80% of farmers globally. In one area or the other, crucially contributes to the success of your farm.</li>
                <li>Equipment and wrong implementations in poultry farming system: This is a main problem and mostly the root of many other problems that causes insufficiency and shortfalls in farm targets and goals.</li>
                <li>Diseases and parasites is a great poultry farming system problem: Diseases and parasites can cause losses production. Some breeds of birds are resistance to certain diseases which make them superior to those that are easily infected by many diseases. Moreover, if you want aim for maximum production, do all you could to prevent them against any kind of diseases.</li>
                <li>Feed related problem poultry farming system: Feeding related problem is another problem we need to consider as this determines the growth of rate of our birds. <br />
                Feeding is more than just given the birds feeds. Healthy production needs balanced diets. Nutrient deficiencies can adversely affect the growth level of production. The level of bird feed will depend on its sizes, energy level of the feed and temperature of the house.</li>
                <li>Water related Problem: This problem should not be underrated, the quality of water available is very important, the acidity of the water must be checked and balanced before we give to the birds. Acidic water will imply negative effect to the life of the birds as this will affect them in many ways.</li>
                <li>Temperature Controlling & Ventilation: Reflection of around 90% of heat in farm and reduction in operating cost and visible reduction in animal mortality.</li>
                <li>Energy & Power Supplies: Analyzing the energy consumption of specific processes Identifying areas of energy wastage in farms. Assessing the current and future energy needs, provide the latest supporting technologies.</li>

        <p>Energy is a major key success factor for every poultry farm, it plays a crucial role in poultry business. driving the systems and equipment that create ideal environment to keep chickens healthy and fast growing for beneficial and excellent conditions.</p>
        <p>Electricity power is at the core of a productive farm, from lighting, heating, ventilation, cooling to motors and machines. Electricity generation from renewables has been growing rapidly during the last years, driven by technological progress, economies of scale, and deployment subsidies. </p>
        <p>A renewable energy reduces your financial risks by; Lock in stable power prices and remove the exposure to price volatility of fossil fuel power. The International Renewable Energy Agency says that renewable energy is now at least as cheap as other sources of electricity in many markets and all major renewable energy technologies will be cheaper than fossil fuels by 2020.</p>
        <p>Renewables are one of the major options to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and are expected to grow significantly in importance throughout the coming decades (IPCC 2011, IEA 2012). According to official targets, the share of renewables in EU electricity consumption shall reach 35% by 2020 and 60- 80% in 2050, up from 17% in 2008. As hydro power potentials are largely exploited in many regions, and biomass growth is limited by supply constraints and sustainability concerns, much of the growth will need to come from wind and solar power. </p>
        <p>We are glad at Dnsh to provide our experience and capability to deliver guaranteed results to your renewables projects. Our responsibilities start from the early stages of site selection, feasibility, project design and planning, to legal requirements and project accomplishment.</p>
